I would only use this for debug not sure what impact this can have the longer you play only use for debug.
Once you have your mp3s working revert back or commit out those lines.

Make a copy of the file from your mod folder (NOT VORTEX) before replacing can just move to your desktop.
Place this file in the same location
DO NOT DEPLOY THROUGH VORTEX JUST START THE GAME.

I highly recommended this mod for testing.
Skip Radio Song - https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6170


Only this line was added in for debug. lines 132 - 135

           -- Print line added for debug of song ticks
            print("[RadioExt Debug] Song: " .. self.currentSong.path ..
                 " | Tick: " .. tostring(self.tick) ..
                 " / " .. tostring(self.currentSong.length))
